# status.jsrowe.com

Should've every human have a status page? This is mine to convey a sense of permanence. If I'm not forever; maybe my Readme is.

# Not me James, but another.

When hunting for a domain I found out that `isjamesalive.com` was already registered. Toronto? Canada? `whois` as of 2024 points to `https://www.tucows.com`. So I shifted to this `status` page concept and built it as a subdomain off `jsrowe.com`.

Hope you're still alive James of [https://www.isjamesalive.com](https://www.isjamesalive.com).
